Compilation of lab solutions during the 4 years of Computer Science Engineering (B.Tech) of different Labs.

## Labs Included:
  * Computer Networks Lab
    Using [OMNeT++](https://www.omnetpp.org/) to simulate Computer Networks. The files included are the key files, which can be 
    imported in the project directly. Assignment's corresponding questions are also included along with the solution code.
    
  * Operating Systems Lab

## To Do:
  * Add more Labs
  * Add pictres/gifs of simulations
  * Attach questions/assignment-problems to the solutions

`Do Note that this isn't a thorough compilation! It does not contain the solutions of all the labs, and/or might be buggy!`


Feel free to contribute!
